# Big Cross

Find the biggest '+' shape within the given matrices

# Assignment

- Implement method **bigCross1** which receives a matrix and its size as arguments and returns the biggest cross. Naive solution. Method must be of time complexity O(n^3).
- Implement method **bigCross2** which receives a matrix and its size as arguments and returns the biggest cross. Use another data structure with time complexity of O(n^2). Method must be of time complexity O(n^2).
